# ErrorTip

This is a component used to render errors next to each input. It's fully style-able, but [bloom-starter](https://github.com/vineyard-bloom/bloom-starter) includes styles to make it look like a tooltip pointed to the input.

### Required Props
- `contents`:
    A string or a React element to populate the error tip

### Optional Props
- `className`:
    A string to style the ErrorTip
- `direction`:
    A string indicating which direction the arrow is pointing. By default, it's 'top'.
