# Bloom Inputs
### Accessible inputs in React

## What & Why
This library provides fully-accessible, reusable input components with easily-overridable default styles. They don't depend on Redux or other stateful libraries to function, but it's recommended to use them with [bloom-forms](https://github.com/vineyard-bloom/bloom-inputs), as the HOC form wrapper there provides all the needed hooks.

The requirements surrounding accessibility in user-driven fields can be a lot of remember, especially when custom components (for stylability) are used. Bloom-inputs tries to solve this problem by providing drop-in inputs of many types.
